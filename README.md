# NodeTS
This is a repository made to start learning and practicing TypeScript with NodeJS

It reuses my code from [edusign-micro-projet-back](https://github.com/CedricTheveneau/edusign-micro-projet-back) as a base that I'm turning into a TypeScript version.

## Personal take on TS
So far, it's not thaaaat difficult, I wouldn't even say it's difficult per say, but it's more demanding and requires more attention to details. It's a really interesting coat of code on top of JS.
